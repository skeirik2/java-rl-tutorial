JavaRL Tutorial README:
=======================

This archive is designed to present the basics of JavaRL.

The main references in this archive are java-pres.pdf
and tut.sh. The PDF contains high-level information about
how JavaRL works. The file tut.sh contains more specific
information about how to configure and run the JavaRL tool.

NOTE-1: JavaRL currently doesn't run on Windows.
NOTE-2: JavaRL requires a working Java Virtual Machine (JVM)
        on your machine. Thus, you should first download
        and install the JVM, available from:

        https://www.oracle.com/java/index.html

        or from your linux distribution's package manager.
NOTE-3: JavaRL must be configured first or it will crash.
        Consult the file tut.sh in this distribution for
        more information.
NOTE-4: The JavaRL parser is, unfortunately, not very
        robust. Thus, check your properties you want to
        verify carefully. See further notes in tut.sh.
